# ViKIENet
In this work, we propose the virtual key instance enhanced network (ViKIENet), a highly efficient and effective multi-modal feature fusion
framework that fuses the features of virtual key instances(VKIs) and LiDAR points through multiple stages. Our contributions include three main components: semantic key
instance selection (SKIS), virtual-instance-focused fusion(VIFF), and virtual-instance-to-real attention (VIRA). We also propose the extended version ViKIENet-R with VIFF-R which includes rotationally equivariant features. Experiment results show that ViKIENet and ViKIENet-R achieve significant improvements in detection performance on the
KITTI, JRDB, and nuScenes datasets compared to existing works. On the KITTI dataset, ViKIENet and ViKIENet-R operate at 22.7 and 15.0 FPS, respectively. As of CVPR submission (Nov. 15th, 2024), ViKIENet ranks first on the car detection and orientation estimation leaderboard, while ViKIENet-R ranks second (compared with officially published papers) on the 3D car detection leaderboard.
